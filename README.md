# Notebook

The notebook is a small collection of personal and public notes inspired by
[Azer Ko√ßulu's](https://github.com/azer) [notebook](https://github.com/azer/notebook).

I'll be adding notes related on my work in the IT industry, personal life experience
and (general) knowledge and some stuff I am interested in.

Feel free to open issues and pull requests.
